A **Next.js 16**, **React 19**, and **Tailwind CSS v4** starter template, with:

- ✨ Radix UI + `class-variance-authority` (CVA)
- 🌗 Dark mode support via `next-themes`
- 🌀 Fully configured Tailwind CSS v4 (JIT, semantic colors, font vars)
- 🎨 Custom UI components and utility functions
- 🧪 Playwright for end-to-end testing
- 🎯 Prettier + Tailwind plugin + ESLint Flat Config
- ⚙️ Modern Server Actions — cleanly integrated and working out of the box

> This is my personal and production-ready starting point for all modern apps — clean, fast, and independent of any deployment service.

## 🚀 Getting Started

```bash
yarn install        # install dependencies
yarn dev            # start dev server (Turbopack)
yarn build          # production build
yarn lint           # run ESLint
yarn typecheck      # run TypeScript checks
yarn test           # run Playwright e2e tests
```

## 🧪 Tailwind CSS v4 Confirmation

This repo ships with a homepage that **visually proves** Tailwind CSS v4 is working:

- Typography, spacing, color, layout, and dark mode all tested
- Custom utility classes, font variables, and semantic tokens verified
- Button variants use `cva` + Radix UI + Tailwind with full theming support

> No guessing — if the homepage renders correctly, your Tailwind setup is fully functional.

---

## ⚡ Server Action Example

The homepage also includes a real, working Server Action:

- Accepts a name input
- Saves to a cookie
- Renders the result with zero JavaScript hydration

```ts
// lib/actions/example.action.ts
"use server";

export async function submitName(formData: FormData) {
  const name = formData.get("name");
  // cookie logic, revalidatePath
}
```

Used directly in `app/page.tsx` via:

```tsx
<form action={submitName}>
```

## 🧠 Customization Tips

- Change your fonts in `app/layout.tsx`
- Add global metadata in `lib/seo.ts`
- Extend button variants via `cva`
- Write your own server actions under `lib/actions/`

## 🛡️ Playwright Setup

```bash
yarn test       # run headless tests
yarn test:ui    # interactive runner
```

Add specs under `tests/`.
